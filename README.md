An AI driven project which contains an implied volatility surface calculated by the Black Scholes equation .
IT has three variables(x,y,z) or (DTE (date to expiration/time to maturity),Strike Price ,Implied Volatility).
This project is fully automated built for XAUUSD implied vol surface  adn just by its skew,ATM vol and its spot price the AI its able to detect his  REGIME (bearish,bullish neutral...)
IT includes the value for the spot price to change it to live price if needed,the camera lock and unlock which its not working and the live time for GMT
Whenever spot price is change you must click on the Update button.
